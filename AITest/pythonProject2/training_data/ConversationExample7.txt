Hi
Hello, how are you?
I'm fine,
Just fine? Why?
I'm a bit stressed
What is making you feel stressed?
University
Is it exams?
Yes, I am feeling anxious about them
That's ok, everyone feels at least a little anxious about exams
Thanks, but I feel really worried about them
Have you tried talking to any support services at your university?
No, I haven't tried that
You should look at your universities website, there will be support available there
